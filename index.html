            About Italy
        </h2>
        <p>
            Italy is a peninsula that juts into the Mediterranean Sea. <br>
            The cities of Italy are known for being unique, competetive, <br>
            and independent. Italy was a part of the Roman Empire, <br>
            a world power that stretched from India to Scotland. The <br>
            language of the Roman Empire was latin, but the language <br>
            has died out and now Italian is the primary language of Italy. <br>
            The capital of Italy, Rome, is home to almost 3 million people. <br>
            The climate, landscape, culture, and historic sites of Italy <br>
            attract many tourits.
